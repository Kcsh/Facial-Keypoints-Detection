# Facial-Keypoints-Detection

The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:

1.tracking faces in images and video

2.analysing facial expressions

3.detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis

4.biometrics / face recognition

Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem.  Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. Computer vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties, but there remain many opportunities for improvement.
